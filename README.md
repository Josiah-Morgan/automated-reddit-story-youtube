Program that scraps Reddit comments then makes a video with them, and then will post it on Youtube


In the resources/config.py set the folders for images, videos, etc., Put your Reddit api details, and some Youtube OAuth info (Watch this for help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfWe1gPCnzc)

Also need Youtube Data api from the Google console with the upload scope

For the background videos you would need to put more I put 28 and make sure the name of the videos are numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.)
